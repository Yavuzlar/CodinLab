## What is CODINLAB?

CODINLAB is an **open-source software lab** designed to help users learn programming from scratch. Developed with **Golang** as the backend and **React.js** for the frontend, CODINLAB provides comprehensive **roadmaps** and **hands-on labs** that allow users to grasp the syntax and structure of various programming languages, along with a focus on specific topics within those languages. 

The project is easily extensible and deployable via **Docker Compose**, making it simple for developers to get started or contribute to the project.

## Features

- **Language-Specific Roadmaps**: Roadmaps provide a step-by-step guide to learning languages like:
  - Python
  - C++
  - Golang
  - And more...
  
  Each roadmap offers focused learning on different areas such as:
    - Basic Syntax and Concepts
    - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
    - Functional Programming
    - Backend and Frontend Development

- **Algorithmic Labs**: Improve problem-solving skills through language-agnostic challenges that focus on data structures and algorithms.
  
- **Sample Projects**: Apply your skills by building real-world projects included in the roadmaps.
  
- **Progress Tracking**: Keep track of your development journey as you complete labs and projects within each roadmap.

- **User Management**: Organize and manage different users with role-based permissions and customizable access control.

- **Extensible Architecture**: Easily extend CODINLAB with new roadmaps, languages, or additional labs using the plugin architecture.

- **Docker Compose Support**: Quick and straightforward setup with Docker Compose, making deployment a breeze for any user.

## Installation

To run CODINLAB locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/codinlab/codinlab.git
    cd codinlab/docker
    ```

2. Use Docker Compose to launch the application:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

3. Once the application is up, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:80` to start using CODINLAB.

## Roadmaps

CODINLAB offers various **roadmaps** that guide users from basic to advanced programming concepts. These roadmaps are tailored to help you understand the following:

- **Programming Language Syntax**: Grasp the fundamental syntax and structures of different languages.
- **Specific Language Areas**: Focus on key areas such as backend development, functional programming, and object-oriented design.
- **Data Structures and Algorithms**: Master essential problem-solving techniques used in the real world for any software development role.

## Labs

CODINLAB provides two types of labs:
- **Language-Specific Labs**: Hands-on labs designed to help users dive deep into specific programming languages with exercises and sample projects.
  
- **Algorithmic Labs**: Labs that focus on language-independent algorithmic challenges and data structures, helping users improve their problem-solving skills.
